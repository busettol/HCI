# HCI
This app prototype is made for students trying to access course material. A priority was made while making this to keep senior students who may need to use this app in mind as they might not be as tech savvy as the younger students.

New Desireable Functionalities

The 5 functionalities I want my app to support include:
1. A file sharing system so its easy for teacher to student, as well as student to student to collaboration on work.
2. A fully functional chat system. Slate for example only allows for Email between users, but a much faster and effective approach would be to have an instant messaging feature as a main point of contact.
3. A tutorial feature would be one that would be very useful for the older students that we are aiming for. Showing them how to navigate the app for the first time will get them more comfortable with using it from the very start.
4. Meeting booking feature would allow for students to access resources like tutors in a specific department. From there they can contact and set up a metting with someone straight through the app.
5. Pinned tasks. This is something that I wish Slate had. The ability to pin certain assignments, tests, or lecture notes to the course homepage would be very helpful. For example, being able to pin the Class Plan file from each class to its homepage would make it so much easier than trying to dig through 10 weeks worth of content to try and find it as sometimes it feels like some files can get lost amongst so many others.
